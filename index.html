      <p>
        An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that
        is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. Airplanes
        come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses
        for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and
        research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers
        annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometres of
        cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. Most airplanes
        are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or
        computer-controlled.<br><br>

        The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the
        first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". They built on the
        works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern
        airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders).
        Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal also
        studied heavier-than-air flight. Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft
        technology continued to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles
        of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The
        first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707,
        the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than
        50 years, from 1958 to at least 2013.
