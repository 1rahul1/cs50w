          <p>
            An amphibious aircraft or amphibian is an aircraft that can take off and land
            on both land and water. Fixed-wing amphibious aircraft are seaplanes (flying
            boats and floatplanes) that are equipped with retractable wheels, at the expense
            of extra weight and complexity, plus diminished range and fuel economy compared
            to planes designed for land or water only. Some amphibians are fitted with reinforced
            keels which act as skis, allowing them to land on snow or ice with their wheels up.
