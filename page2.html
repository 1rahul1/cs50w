          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            A business jet, private jet, or bizjet is a jet aircraft designed for transporting small
            groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation
            of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, government
            officials or the armed forces.
          </p>
          <h2>Market</h2>
          <p>
            On 1 April 2017, there were 22,368 business jets in the worldwide fleet,
            of which 11.2% were for sale. 5-year old aircraft residual value level is
            at a 56% of the list price. A new business aircraft depreciate by 50% in
            five years before depreciation flattens between years 10 and 15, and the owner
            of a 15 to 20 years old is often the last, matching luxury cars.
          </p>
          <p>
            About 70% of the fleet was in North America at the end of 2011.
            The European market is the next largest, with growing activity in the Middle
            East, Asia, and Central America. In 2015 the total airplane billing amounted
            to US$21.9 billion, and 718 business jets were delivered to customers across
            the globe : 199 (27.7%) by Bombardier Aerospace, 166 (23.1%) by Cessna, 154
            (21.4%) by Gulfstream Aerospace, 120 (16.7%) by Embraer and 55 (7.7%) by
            Dassault Falcon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Business jets have varying value retention, between the leading Phenom 300E,
            sold for $9.45 million in 2018 and expected to retain 68% of its value 15
            years later for $6.46 million in 2033, and the trailing $24.5 million
            Gulfstream G280, predicted to retain 42% of its value for $10.25 million.
